# Shorty_AVR_DD - Kicad based design files

## What is it for?

Shorty is short circuit finder, usable for checking PCB, for example. Where normal digital multimeters do not have enough of resolution to differentiate low PCB resistance in order of tens of miliohms to allow exact short circuit location, shorty comes to help.

## Content of this repository

This repository consists of the Kicad files. The design is done with Kicad 9.x.
